# 8-puzzle-with-different-algorithms

 This project focuses on evaluating and comparing solving algorithmsâ€”A* (A-star), DFS (Depth-First Search), UCS (Uniform-Cost Search), BFS (Breadth-First Search), and IDS (Iterative Deepening Search). The primary aim is to assess memory usage, execution time, and the number of moves required by each algorithm to solve the 8 Puzzle Game.

# Comparative Analysis
The comparative analysis provides insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of each algorithm, considering factors such as memory usage, execution time, and the number of moves. This information can assist in selecting the most suitable algorithm based on specific requirements.
